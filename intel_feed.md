Dialogue is the key solution to tensions between the two nations, Beijing claims

Moscow and Kievâ€™s top officials must sit down at the negotiating table to establish a path to de-escalating aggression, one of Beijingâ€™s top diplomats has said, as Russiaâ€™s armed forces continue to attack Ukraine.

Speaking on Monday at an emergency session, Chinaâ€™s permanent representative to the UN, Zhang Jun weighed in on how he believed tensions between the two former Soviet Republics could be eased.

"The most important thing right now is to return to the track of diplomatic negotiations and [create] a political settlement as soon as possible to help de-escalate the situation," he claimed.

According to the diplomat, "China supports direct dialogue and negotiation between Russia and Ukraine," which he insists is the definitive way to resolve the conflict. Zhang also said that the international community should "prioritize regional peace, stability and the universal security for all."
